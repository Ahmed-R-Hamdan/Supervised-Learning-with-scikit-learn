# Supervised-Learning-with-scikit-learn
**Scikit-Learn**, also known as sklearn is a python library to implement machine learning models and statistical modelling. Through scikit-learn, we can implement various machine learning models for regression, classification, clustering, and statistical tools for analyzing these models. It also provides functionality for dimensionality reduction, feature selection, feature extraction, ensemble techniques, and inbuilt datasets. We will be looking into these features one by one.

This library is built upon NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib.

**Supervised learning** is a type of machine learning where the values to be predicted are already known, and a model is built with the aim of accurately predicting values of previously unseen data. Supervised learning uses features to predict the value of a target variable, such as predicting a basketball player's position based on their points per game. This course will exclusively focus on supervised learning.

There are two types of supervised learning.

1- Classification

  Used to predict the label, or category, of an observation. For example, we can predict whether a bank transaction is fraudulent or not. As there are two outcomes here - a fraudulent transaction, or non-fraudulent transaction, this is known as binary classification.

2- Regression

  Used to predict continuous values. For example, a model can use features such as number of bedrooms, and the size of a property, to predict the target variable, price of the property.
